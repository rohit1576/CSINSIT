This web app requires facebook login of the user using passport.js
The app fetches all the posts from the facebook page of CSI-NSIT and displays them according to the no. of likes and then by no. of shares.
The above feature is implemented using Facebook Graph-API.

Steps for running this web app:
    git clone <repo-url> this repo wherever you want
    cd into this repo
    npm install
    
    Note: The database is hosted on MongoLab, so no need to worry about that.
    
    now run the server by $ node app.js
    
    
    
Open your favourite browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see it in action
